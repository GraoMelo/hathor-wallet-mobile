You can use any text editor you'd like to. But there are some specific for PO files. We are using the POEdit (https://poedit.net/).

- You don't have to translate the text inside ${} blocks, just copy it in the right position. E.g., ${ symbol }.

- For calendar expressions, you just have to translate the text inside brackets. E.g., [Today â€¢] HH:mm.

- The sentences between two asterisks are in bold. E.g., This wallet is connected to the **mainnet**.

- The string between two bars (|) are special. They have the format |key:sentence|. You must keep the key and translate only the sentence. E.g., |link:here| -> |link:aqui|
